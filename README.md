# lazarus-foldercopy
Simple directory copy example in Lazarus. Uses LCL, so should be cross platform.

Also, has checkboxes for flags passed to copy function. So should be easy to check functionality before implementing in a project.

If you want to check out the compiled executable (EXEs), click on the [Release](https://github.com/adnan360/lazarus-foldercopy/releases) link above. You could find executables for Windows and Linux there. For Linux executable, try `chmod +x /path/to/proj_foldercopy` and then you can execute it.

The executables may be compressed with UPX, so some anti virus programs may show a false positive. If unsure, you can compile yourself.
